 <h1>Learn about the Geomagnetic Strom</h1></div><br><br><br>
<body>
    <br><The May 2024 geomagnetic storms were truly a spectacular sight! They were triggered by a series of powerful solar flares and coronal mass ejections from solar active region NOAA 13664, producing an extreme G5-class geomagnetic storm ¹. <br> This storm was the most powerful to affect Earth since March 1989, causing stunning aurorae displays at far more equatorial latitudes than usual in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. <br>
    <br>
<h3>Aurora Sightings Around the World: </h3><br>

- North America: Aurorae were spotted across the United States, as far south as the Florida Keys, Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, The Bahamas, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico ¹. <br>
- Europe: The aurora was visible from Portugal, Spain, Sardinia, Algeria, and the Canary Islands ¹. <br>
- Asia: Aurorae were seen in Turkey, Cyprus, Iran, Japan, northern India, South Korea, and across northern China ¹. <br>
- Australia and New Zealand: The aurora was visible as far north as Townsville and Mackay in Queensland, and across New Zealand ¹. <br>
- South America and Africa: Aurorae were spotted in Chile, Argentina, South Africa, and as far north as New Caledonia, Uruguay, southern Brazil, and Namibia ¹. <br>
<br>
<h3>The storm's impact was significant, causing disruptions to radio communications, power grids, and satellite services. However, widespread power outages were avoided thanks to preparations by power companies ¹.</h3> <br>
